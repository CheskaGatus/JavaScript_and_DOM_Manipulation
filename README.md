# JavaScript_and_DOM_Manipulation

Automatic Table and Date Search

- Created a basic HTML web page.
- Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote a code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
- Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Multiple Search Categories
- Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, I wrote a JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
